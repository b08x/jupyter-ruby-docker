This project provides Docker images that bundle a Jupyter Notebook server preconfigured with a Ruby kernel (IRuby) and a comprehensive suite of RubyGems focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and language model utilities.

## Features

- **Ruby Kernel for Jupyter**: Use IRuby to run Ruby code interactively within Jupyter notebooks.
- **NLP Libraries**: Includes gems for text tokenization, sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and various language utilities.
- **Cross-Language Integration**: Leverage Python libraries (like spaCy, NLTK, Transformers) from Ruby via [pycall](https://github.com/mrkn/pycall.rb) for mixed-language workflows.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize gems like [daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru) and [daru-view](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru-view) for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Includes `pgvector`, `chroma-db` and `redis` services via Docker Compose for vector similarity searches.
- **TTY Gem Suite**: Includes components from the [TTY-Toolkit](https://ttytoolkit.org/) to create great Terminal Apps.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Recommended for full functionality).
- Basic familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks and Docker commands.

## Building the Images

The project contains two primary Docker images: `base` and `nlp`.

- **[base](./base/README.md)**: A foundational image built upon `jupyter/docker-stacks-foundation`, including JupyterLab, common Python data science libraries, and essential NLP tools like spaCy and Google Generative AI SDK.
- **[nlp](./nlp/README.md)**: Built upon the `base` image, this adds Ruby, IRuby kernel, and a wide range of Ruby NLP gems.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/b08x/jupyter-ruby-docker.git
    cd jupyter-ruby-docker
    ```

2. **Build the Images**

    You can build the images individually using `docker build` or use the provided `Rakefile`:

    - **Using Docker Build (NLP image, depends on base):**

        ```bash
        # Build the base image first (if not pulled from a registry)
        docker build -t b08x/notebook-base:latest -f base/Dockerfile .

        # Build the NLP image
        docker build -t b08x/notebook-nlp:latest -f nlp/Dockerfile .
        ```

    - **Using Rake (Recommended):**

        ```bash
        # Install rake if not already installed
        bundle install
        
        # Build the nlp image (will build base automatically if needed)
        rake build/nlp

        # Or build all defined images
        rake build-all
        ```

## Running the Container

You can run the `nlp` image using either `docker run` or `docker-compose`. Using `docker-compose` is recommended as it also sets up the `redis` and `pgvector` services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Using `docker run` (Notebook only)

This method starts only the Jupyter notebook container.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "${PWD}/work":/home/jovyan/work \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  b08x/notebook-nlp:latest
```

**Explanation:**

- `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it exits.
- `-p 8888:8888`: Map port 8888 on your host to port 8888 in the container.
- `-v "${PWD}/work":/home/jovyan/work`: Mount a local directory named `work` into the container's home directory. **Create this directory (`mkdir work`) in your project folder first.** This allows you to persist your notebooks and data.
- `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`: Run the container using your current user and group ID to avoid permission issues with mounted volumes.
- `b08x/notebook-nlp:latest`: The image to run.

**Access Jupyter:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8888` (or `http://<your-docker-ip>:8888`). The startup logs in your terminal will display an authentication tokenâ€”use it to log in.

### Using `docker-compose` (Recommended: Notebook + Redis + Pgvector)

This method uses the `docker-compose.yml` file to start the `nlp-notebook`, `redis`, and `pgvector` services together.

1. **Environment Setup (`.env` file):**
    Copy the example environment file (`.env.example`) to `.env` and configure the variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to set the following:
    - **`UID` & `GID`**: (Optional) Set these to your user and group ID (`id -u` and `id -g`) if they are not 1000. This ensures correct file permissions for mounted volumes.
    - **`WORKSPACE`**: (Optional) Set this to the **absolute path** of the directory on your host machine where you want to store your notebooks and work files. If left empty or undefined, the `docker-compose.yml` will default to mounting a `./data` directory (relative to the project root) into the container at `/home/jovyan/work`.
    - **API Keys**: (Optional) Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_PALM_API_KEY`, and `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` if you plan to use services requiring them within your notebooks.

2. **Create Necessary Directories:**
    Depending on your `.env` configuration and the `docker-compose.yml` settings, ensure the necessary host directories exist before starting the services.
    - **If `WORKSPACE` is set in `.env`:** Make sure the directory specified by `WORKSPACE` exists.
      ```bash
      # Example if WORKSPACE=/path/to/my/notebooks
      mkdir -p /path/to/my/notebooks
      ```
    - **If `WORKSPACE` is *not* set in `.env`:** Create the default `./data` directory.
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ./data
      ```
    - **For the read-only Library mount:** The default `docker-compose.yml` also mounts `$HOME/Documents` as read-only to `/home/jovyan/Library`. Ensure this directory exists if you intend to use it.
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/Documents
      ```

3. **Start Services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    - `-d`: Run containers in detached mode (in the background).

4. **Access Jupyter:**
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:8888`. Use the token from the logs (`docker-compose logs nlp-notebook`).

5. **Access RedisInsight:**
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:8001`.

6. **Stopping Services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Overview of Included RubyGems

For a complete list, review the [nlp/README](./nlp/README.md).

## Customization & Development

You can customize the Docker images in several ways:

- **Ruby Gems:** To add or update Ruby gems, modify the `nlp/Gemfile`. Then, rebuild the `nlp` image using `rake build/nlp` or `docker build -f nlp/Dockerfile .`.
- **Python Packages:** To add or update Python packages, edit the `pip install` or `mamba install` commands within the `base/Dockerfile`. After making changes, you'll need to rebuild both the `base` and `nlp` images.
- **System Packages:** If you need additional system libraries, add the necessary `apt-get install` commands to the appropriate Dockerfile:
  - Use `base/Dockerfile` for dependencies needed by Python or the base environment.
  - Use `nlp/Dockerfile` for dependencies needed specifically for Ruby or at runtime.
    Remember to rebuild the relevant image(s) after adding packages.
- **Jupyter Configuration:** Modify Jupyter settings by editing `base/jupyter_server_config.py` or the startup scripts (like `base/start-notebook.py`). Rebuild the images after making configuration changes.
- **Kernel Patching:** The `nlp/Dockerfile` includes a step to apply `respond_to_missing.patch` to the `ruby-spacy` gem. You can customize this patch file if needed and rebuild the `nlp` image.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Issues**: Verify build dependencies and Docker daemon resources. Check build logs for errors.
- **Kernel Registration**: If the Ruby kernel doesn't appear, ensure `iruby register --force` ran successfully during the `nlp` image build (`docker logs <container_id>` or check build output).
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 8888 (or others like 6379, 5432) is in use, modify the `docker run -p` mapping or the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Volume Permissions**: If you encounter permission errors with mounted volumes, ensure the `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` flag is used with `docker run` or that the `UID`/`GID` in your `.env` file matches your host user when using `docker-compose`.
